Step 0) Assumptions:

	The first assumption is that you have Borland Pascal installed in C:\BP.  
	If you don't, you'll have to update the BUILDBP.CMD file

	The second assumption is that you have Virtual Pascal installed in C:\vp21.
	If you don't, you'll have to update the BUILDVP.CMD file

	*NOTE* The BUILD*.CMD files will copy a BPC.CFG or VPC.CFG into the relevant bin directory, meaning
	if you have cusomized the .CFG file in the bin directory, it will be lost.  Make a backup!

Step 1) Create directories to hold everything:

	Z:\Usurper
	Z:\Programming\Usurper
	Z:\Programming\Usurper\EXE\BP
	Z:\Programming\Usurper\EXE\VP

	If you don't have a Z: drive, you can use SUBST or map a network drive to fake one
	You can also put the files in an alternate location if you want, you'll just have to update the BUILD*.CMD scripts

Step 2) Get the source

	Check out the GIT contents into Z:\Programming\Usurper

Step 3) Edit C:\vp21\source\tv\dialogs.pas

	TLabel.HandleEvent has a bug that will cause EDITOR32 to crash.  So go to line 2068, which should be:

    C := HotKey(Text^);
    if (GetAltCode(C) = Event.KeyCode) or
       ((C <> #0) and (Owner^.Phase = phPostProcess) and
        (UpCase(Event.CharCode) = C)) then FocusLink

	And wrap it in a check to see if Text is assigned.  In other words, replace it with:

    if Assigned(Text) then
    begin
      C := HotKey(Text^);
      if (GetAltCode(C) = Event.KeyCode) or
         ((C <> #0) and (Owner^.Phase = phPostProcess) and
          (UpCase(Event.CharCode) = C)) then FocusLink
    end;

Step 4) Build new EXEs

	Run BUILDBP.CMD to build the DOS EXEs and have them copied to Z:\Usurper

	Run BUILDVP.CMD to build the WIN32 EXEs and have them copied to Z:\Usurper
