Install Lazarus (only 32bit version has been tested)

Open EDITOR.lpi and hit SHIFT-F9 (Build)
Open USURPER.lpi and hit SHIFT-F9 (Build)

NOTE: Always use the Build option when switching between projects.
EDITOR and USURPER have some files with the same name but with different
contents, and since they compile to the same directory this can cause
problems.  So if you get weird errors while compiling, do a build instead.
